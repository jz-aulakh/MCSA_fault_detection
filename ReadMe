# Induction Motor Fault Detection using MCSA & Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project implements **Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA)** combined with **machine learning** techniques to detect faults in an induction motor. The approach is non-invasive and suitable for condition monitoring.

## ⚙️ Faults Detected
- Broken Rotor Bar
- Bearing Inner Race Fault
- Bearing Outer Race Fault
- Healthy Condition

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- MATLAB (FFT, signal processing)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, KNN, etc.)
- Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA)

## 📊 Methodology
1. Stator current acquisition
2. Signal conditioning and FFT
3. Feature extraction in frequency domain
4. ML-based fault classification
5. Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## 📈 Results
- Random Forest and KNN achieved highest accuracy
- Ensemble and instance-based models performed better than linear models
